Our team has come together from a diverse set of academic and professional backgrounds: software development, computer science, mathematics, physics, and metallurgy. Our goal is to leverage this expertise through trust and cooperation. We want to foster an environment where team members have frequent opportunities to learn from each other in fields that they are not (yet) experts.</p><br /><p>The machine learning and data science we employ comes in several varieties: image processing, signal processing, classical supervised modeling, unsupervised methods, exploratory data analysis, and fundamental statistics and probability. As a frontend software engineer, your specific expertise as well as your motivation would be the major factors in determining your day-to-day work.</p><br /><p>We are grateful to stand on the shoulders of the open source giants. We use NumPy-flavored Python3 as the basis for our development, taking advantage of the availability of libraries designed for both software engineering and data science, ranging from Flask to SciPy, SQLAlchemy to Keras, Jupyter to Pandas, and many more. When Python&rsquo;s time or space complexity becomes a constraint, we turn to modern C++. When we require client-side browser-based interactivity, we turn to JavaScript.</p><br /><p><strong>HOW WE DEFINE THE FRONTEND</strong></p><br /><p>Currently, we use Python&rsquo;s Flask with Jinja templating to deliver visualizations and interfaces powered by HighCharts, Bootstrap and jQuery. This means that, for us, the frontend starts with Python and ends with whatever is possible in the user&rsquo;s browser. We do not aim to build single page applications or dashboards, rather interfaces whose usability for process engineers is competitive with the desktop applications that have been battle tested for decades.</p><br /><p>The ideal frontend that we work towards is not isolated from the rest of the development team, but instead utilized to more effectively bring a cohesive product to our customers. In order to meet this goal, it is our impression that the proper abstraction layer does not exist between Python and JavaScript, rather within JavaScript itself. The role of the frontend software engineer is then to develop and maintain a JavaScript API that abstracts complexity away from teammates that are focused on other components of the product, while also developing and solidifying the frontend&rsquo;s role in the greater product stack.</p><br /><p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Collaboratively develop, design, and deploy interactive, dynamic UX solutions</li><br /><li>Leverage your own experience and expertise to guide the shape of the frontend</li><br /><li>Work alongside machine learning engineers to optimize visualizations and product experience</li><br /><li>Define, develop and maintain the role of the frontend within the product technology stack</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS THAT CATCH OUR EYE</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A significant technical background with a transition to a design-oriented role, or a significant design-oriented background with a transition to a technical role</li><br /><li>Experience creating responsive layouts that adhere to principles of usability, compatibility and accessibility</li><br /><li>Experience developing browser-based visualizations of time series or other industrial data</li><br /><li>Experience working alongside and within a Python server framework, especially Flask</li><br /><li>Fluency in German or Russian is a plus; English is required</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Transparency of business strategies</li><br /><li>Autonomy balanced by responsibility</li><br /><li>Cohesive, multidisciplinary team</li><br /><li>Meaningful industrial problems</li><br /><li>Modern machine learning techniques</li><br /><li>Sleek, new office located in Berlin</li><br /><li>Professional educational opportunities</li><br /><li>German language courses and public transport included</li><br /><li>Free drinks and fruits</li><br /></ul>","Sat, 08 Feb 2020 08:27:06 Z",2020-02-08T08:27:06Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"Berlin, Germany",

Free access is made possible by our growing base of power users (both students and teachers) who pay to subscribe to our premium features. Our focus is to improve our renewals, creating compelling upsell experiences, explore new payment options, offer different plans that meet users&rsquo; need as Quizlet grow internationally.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p>&nbsp;<strong>Study </strong><em><span>SF</span></em></p><br /><p><span>The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to study and master the content in Quizlet and looking for ways to improve our study modes like ML adaptive Learn mode. One of the current projects is modernizing the Study modes to a shared core logic in Kotlin, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.</span></p><br /><p><strong>Discover </strong><em><span>SF</span></em></p><br /><p><span>Team Discover is one of Quizlet&rsquo;s product engineering teams focused on user engagement and improving core product features.

The Content Services team identifies the parts of our system that are bumping up against the most intransigent data-scalability challenges and builds solutions that give us the breathing room to continue scaling those areas by at least tenfold. This typically involves migrating data from MySQL to other database systems, such as Google Cloud Spanner. It also involves innovating in the way we structure our applications: moving toward a service-oriented architecture that allows us to choose the right tools for each job, manage and scale services independently, and make our system more resilient. Nowadays this work features Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and it requires keeping up to date on the technology landscape for global-scale persistent data stores.</span></p>","Tue, 11 Feb 2020 07:54:33 Z",2020-02-11T07:54:33Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"San Francisco, CA",

They help all parts of the organization including Pods, People Ops, Marketing, User Ops, and Engineering.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Subscriptions- Innovation&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The team's mission is to deliver excellence to our subscribers through premium features that target their needs to succeed. Some of the features we&rsquo;ve built are: OCR to efficiently create content from a picture of printed materials, offline access, rich text to make key points more memorable, and customized Quizlet Live for our teachers.</p><br /><p><strong>Subscriptions - Growth&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The team takes pride in keeping Quizlet free for anyone to use. Free access is made possible by our growing base of power users (both students and teachers) who pay to subscribe to our premium features. Our focus is to improve our renewals, creating compelling upsell experiences, explore new payment options, offer different plans that meet users&rsquo; need as Quizlet grow internationally.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;<strong>Study&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to study and master the content in Quizlet and looking for ways to improve our study modes like ML adaptive Learn mode. One of the current projects is modernizing the Study modes to a shared core logic in Kotlin, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.</p><br /><p><strong>Discover&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Team Discover is one of Quizlet&rsquo;s product engineering teams focused on user engagement and improving core product features. This includes researching better ways to create, find, and organize content. One of the team&rsquo;s current projects is providing behavioral-based recommendations to users that help them discover new study content that they&rsquo;ll be interested in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Web Infrastructure&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Web Infrastructure team is focused on app performance and developer productivity. A key initiative is wiring GraphQL into our APIs and through our React + Redux client. They enable safe deploys with strong type checking (Flow + TypeScript), comprehensive test coverage (Jest) and full integration testing (Cypress).</p><br /><p><strong>Content Services&nbsp;</strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Quizlet manages many kinds of content, and more of it every moment, to fulfill our mission of helping people around the world learn. The Content Services team identifies the parts of our system that are bumping up against the most intransigent data-scalability challenges and builds solutions that give us the breathing room to continue scaling those areas by at least tenfold. This typically involves migrating data from MySQL to other database systems, such as Google Cloud Spanner. It also involves innovating in the way we structure our applications: moving toward a service-oriented architecture that allows us to choose the right tools for each job, manage and scale services independently, and make our system more resilient. Nowadays this work features Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and it requires keeping up to date on the technology landscape for global-scale persistent data stores.</p>","Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:07:29 Z",2020-02-11T08:07:29Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"San Francisco, CA",

You will have the unique opportunity to learn from the best industry security experts and integrate that into your software and service engineering.</p><br /><p>Our expanding team is looking for experienced Distributed Systems Developer (position level dependent on experience).</p><br /><p>Click to learn more about our<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z18Ml71HVE"" rel=""nofollow""> Culture</a> and our<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBtYfsoh9U8&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow""> Engineering organization</a> through these videos!</p><br /><p><strong>Some key investments in our space include:</strong></p><br /><p><strong><u>Security Foundation Services</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>Develop and deliver reliable and scalable foundational services. These key building blocks - like key and secret management systems, PKI (public key infrastructure), service-to-service authn/authz and data encryption - enable the security of all other services and permit the protection of our customer data.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Identity and Access</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>Design and implement consistent and scalable identity and access services for all of Salesforce, integrating our IT network, public cloud infrastructure, and our own data centers, and empowering all our engineers to operate these environments in a secure manner.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Threat Detection and Response Services</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>Develop highly scalable, automatic and flexible defense system integrating extensive data collection, big data processing, machine learning detection, automatic response, and automatic mitigation across all our data centers, IT infrastructure and public cloud environments.</p><br /><p>Trust is Salesforce&rsquo;s number one value. And we invest heavily in the security space to create the most secure enterprise cloud platform. Threat Detection &amp; Response is one of the most critical components of our security defense system. It involves complex subsystems including massive data collection, detection through complex rules and machine learning, highly scalable response automation, deep investigation capability, and mitigation solutions. All these solutions are built in our cloud environment with large scale distributed system. The architects in the D&amp;R Engineering organization will partner with engineering managers to guide the team to design, implement and run these complex services. You are expected to bring in deep architecture and design knowledge, excellent engineering practice, as well as capability to provide a high-quality hands-on implementation.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Threat and Vulnerability Management Engineering</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>Design, development and implement scalable vulnerability management infrastructure for all of Salesforce, integration of diverse assets data within data centers, public cloud infrastructures, IT network, and provide threat / risk reporting.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Secure Software Development Lifecycle</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>Under this umbrella, we design, build and deliver highly available, disaster proof, public cloud hosted services for the entire Salesforce developer community and increase the security of Salesforce's products. Just a few of these include Credentials Scanning as a Service (find secrets and credentials hidden in our source code), Container Scanning as a Service (ensure that the container images being deployed for AWS, GCP, and Gov Cloud are free of vulnerabilities), 3PP as a Service (ensure that we do not inherit a third party developer's security vulnerabilities), Static Code Analysis as a Service (ensure that the Salesforce's own code -in any language- is free of security Vulnerabilities). These projects are all targeted directly at the developer community and have various touch points including integration with various CI and SCM systems.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Continuous Security Monitoring (CSM)</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>CSM is a continuous process of evidence collection, comparison of evidence to a known standard, and flagging divergence thereby assuring operating effectiveness of security controls. This involves collecting bits of data from endpoints (we've worked with OSQuery and Tanium), pumping that into a data lake (Kafka endpoints with a Hadoop/Hbase over S3 storage), dockerized containers for the backend and job scheduling and finally working that data into Salesforce Objects for dashboards and analytics.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Network Security:</u></strong></p><br /><p>The Network Security Engineering team is building a new internal cloud platform for various network security controls and management. Our mission is to develop highly-available and performant distributed systems to provide security at the network level in our private and public clouds, including micro-segmentation, network policy distribution, access control at host/device level, distributed firewall and DDoS prevention. Our scope is a wide range of compute substrates, including bare metal hosts, VMs, and containers.</p><br /><p>If you have some/most of the key skills below, we have an exciting engineering position for you at all levels:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience and passion for service ownership, building reliable/self-healing services.</li><br /><li>Experience working in a complex team environment.

It involves complex subsystems including massive data collection, detection through complex rules and machine learning, highly scalable response automation, deep investigation capability, and mitigation solutions. All these solutions are built in our cloud environment with large scale distributed system. The architects in the D&amp;R Engineering organization will partner with engineering managers to guide the team to design, implement and run these complex services.

Just a few of these include Credentials Scanning as a Service (find secrets and credentials hidden in our source code), Container Scanning as a Service (ensure that the container images being deployed for AWS, GCP, and Gov Cloud are free of vulnerabilities), 3PP as a Service (ensure that we do not inherit a third party developer's security vulnerabilities), Static Code Analysis as a Service (ensure that the Salesforce's own code -in any language- is free of security Vulnerabilities). These projects are all targeted directly at the developer community and have various touch points including integration with various CI and SCM systems.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Continuous Security Monitoring (CSM)</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><br /><p>CSM is a continuous process of evidence collection, comparison of evidence to a known standard, and flagging divergence thereby assuring operating effectiveness of security controls. This involves collecting bits of data from endpoints (we've worked with OSQuery and Tanium), pumping that into a data lake (Kafka endpoints with a Hadoop/Hbase over S3 storage), dockerized containers for the backend and job scheduling and finally working that data into Salesforce Objects for dashboards and analytics.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Network Security:</u></strong></p><br /><p>The Network Security Engineering team is building a new internal cloud platform for various network security controls and management.

It is used in production at Netflix, Microsoft, Yahoo, Pinterest, Airbnb, and several startups such as CockroachDB and Confluent. We are also leveraging RocksDB in MySQL, the main relational database technology at Facebook.
