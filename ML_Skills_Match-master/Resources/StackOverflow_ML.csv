Interactions happen through front-end interfaces. The truth is: an interface can make or break a machine learning system. To collect data and train machine learning systems, we need high quality interfaces for both: human annotators and end-users. To build next-generation systems that can learn and be taught requires building next-generation interfaces to make this happen. Are you a front-end developer who is interested in machine learning? Machine learning knowledge is not required, but you will certainly pick it up by working with us.</p><br /><p><strong>THIS POSITION:</strong> This is a position for a front-end developer. Your job will be to both <strong>DESIGN</strong>, <strong>DEVELOP</strong>, <strong>TEST</strong> and <strong>SUPERVISE</strong> a team of remote developers to create both front-end and back-end using the Django framework, HTML and CSS. Your role will be critical and the success of our MVP will depend on you.</p><br /><p>1. work closely with Machine Learning scientists/researchers</p><br /><p>2. implement web-based front-end/back-end interfaces with <strong>DJANGO</strong></p><br /><p>3. work with the team to implement overall system architecture</p><br /><p>5. write automatic tests</p><br /><p>6. work closely with annotators, testers to ensure that your interfaces are easy to use</p><br /><p>7. work closely with and supervise a team of remote developers and testers</p><br /><p>The position includes both a salary and equity compensation package.</p>","Tue, 28 Jan 2020 22:35:17 Z",2020-01-28T22:35:17Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"New York, NY",

And the team wants to personalize the learning journey for every Quizlet learner and to make learning more fun. Engineers in this team would also like to harness the power of the community to make studying better.</p><br /><p><strong>Ads and Partners </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The Ads and Partners team has two objectives. The Ads objective is to achieve the highest ads revenue while maintaining or enhancing user experience. This is achieved by moving towards higher-value quality ads product, launching innovative offerings of Ad products in EdTech, and creating a unique inventory for Quizlet. The Partners' objective is to help top tier educational publishers provide their students with integrated digital study tools so we can engineer a holistic experience for the learners.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Agora </strong><em>Denver</em></p><br /><p>Team Agora builds the Premium marketplace which helps people that are studying for high stakes exams.

The effort just got going, and it's a bit like a startup within a startup.</p><br /><p><strong>Pod Infrastructure </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The mission of the Pod Infrastructure team (also known as team Octo) is to power larger,&nbsp;user-facing functionality that helps scale the company. This means cleaning up old code, migrating to new APIs, and fixing underlying issues that empower the Pods to build features more easily and at scale. When possible, team Octo will pull functionality out of Quizlet and into new services. They help all parts of the organization including Pods, People Ops, Marketing, User Ops, and Engineering.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Subscriptions- Innovation </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>The team's mission is to deliver excellence to our subscribers through premium features that target their needs to succeed.

This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to study and master the content in Quizlet and looking for ways to improve our study modes like ML adaptive Learn mode. One of the current projects is modernizing the Study modes to a shared core logic in Kotlin, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.</p><br /><p><strong>Discover </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Team Discover is one of Quizlet&rsquo;s product engineering teams focused on user engagement and improving core product features. This includes researching better ways to create, find, and organize content.

A key initiative is wiring GraphQL into our APIs and through our React + Redux client. They enable safe deploys with strong type checking (Flow + TypeScript), comprehensive test coverage (Jest) and full integration testing (Cypress).</p><br /><p><strong>Content Services </strong><em>SF</em></p><br /><p>Quizlet manages many kinds of content, and more of it every moment, to fulfill our mission of helping people around the world learn. The Content Services team identifies the parts of our system that are bumping up against the most intransigent data-scalability challenges and builds solutions that give us the breathing room to continue scaling those areas by at least tenfold. This typically involves migrating data from MySQL to other database systems, such as Google Cloud Spanner. It also involves innovating in the way we structure our applications: moving toward a service-oriented architecture that allows us to choose the right tools for each job, manage and scale services independently, and make our system more resilient. Nowadays this work features Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and it requires keeping up to date on the technology landscape for global-scale persistent data stores.</p>","Tue, 11 Feb 2020 07:55:46 Z",2020-02-11T07:55:46Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"Denver, CO",

Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don&rsquo;t accept that.</p><br /><p>Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards &mdash; and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we&rsquo;re working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.</p><br /><p>Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others.

We provide manageable, reliable, high QoS database software and services ideal for a wide spectrum of workloads and storage devices, easily accessible from all Facebook products and programming languages. For example, RocksDB has become the de-facto Facebook standard key-value storage engine optimized for flash. Since we open-sourced it, a vibrant community has grown around it. It is used in production at Netflix, Microsoft, Yahoo, Pinterest, Airbnb, and several startups such as CockroachDB and Confluent. We are also leveraging RocksDB in MySQL, the main relational database technology at Facebook. We have converted RocksDB into a pluggable storage engine for MySQL, known as the open-source project MyRocks. Today, the entire Facebook social graph is stored in MyRocks allowing us great savings in terms of storage space and SSD lifetime for the largest MySQL backend on the planet. The database industry took notice and both MariaDB and Percona are actively working at integrating and supporting this novel write-optimized database technology in their corresponding server offering.To support the next 2-orders-of-magnitude growth in data size and QPS, Core Data is embarking on evolving MySQL and other internal technologies into the next-generation database system. Facebook's unique model of data allows us to dynamically copy or move data between Facebook's OLTP, cache, and search engines while our Social ORM enables federated queries across these structured data stores. Further, our rapidly expanding set of applications requires both vertical and horizontal scaling of database technologies. Unconstrained by the requirements of commercial enterprise software, we have numerous challenges like cost effective multi-region replication, data locality, large virtual databases, parallel query, query optimization, and disaggregated storage.We are looking for candidates who share a passion for tackling complexity and building platforms that can scale through multiple orders of magnitude and enable Facebook databases to be fast and high quality.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Design core software components for database systems</li><li>Code using primarily in C++</li><li>Interface with other teams to collaborate in transforming the landscape</li><li>Conduct design and code reviews</li><li>Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stability of various system resources</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>5+ years software engineering experience or coding experience in C, C++, or Java</li><li>2+ years experience building database software</li><li>B.S.
