(Personally, I&rsquo;d like to just not get paged in the evening when we hit peak traffic.) As we transition into more service-oriented architecture we have an increasing need to develop with resilience. We need to retry on fast failures, degrade gracefully, fall back to redundant systems, and anything else that helps us keep delivering to our users. Some even think we can automatically scale our systems to respond to changing load. Can you help us make our systems bulletproof?&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li>Search: Reading the mind of the user and showing them what they want to see virtually before they start typing seems to be the bar in content discovery these days. Using Elasticsearch to power our search and discovery system has got us a long way in performance and scale, but there are always new challenges. We update data a lot, especially around the availability of content in a library, and we need to maintain performance while running those updates. We love facets (and who doesn&rsquo;t?) and we always want more of them, but we need to manage our memory usage. We have a lot of dimensions to our data and we want to query them in interesting new ways, but how do we measure the impact of those queries on our capacity and throughput? If you are interested in search and have a passion for performance and complex engineering, this is the challenge for you! Also, if you understand the JVM, we could really use your help. (Please? I don&rsquo;t want to go back to JVM tuning. Save me!)&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><p>If any of these challenges spark your interest, and you are looking for a place to go on an adventure with great companions to help you on the way, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find any place better. On top of that we develop and create the product and what a joy it is as we just celebrated our 1.5 Billionth download &ndash; what a feeling it is knowing that millions of people around the world love what we create here.</p><br /><p><strong>What we are looking for in candidates:</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for passionate backend developer that will help make our teams and products better by having a passion for writing and creating clean code and desiring to collaborate with others.</p><br /><p>You should be comfortable giving and receiving feedback on code, suggesting improvements to the application or processes, and be able to communicate well in person and in writing.</p><br /><p>Candidates should feel strongly about providing an excellent experience to all users.&nbsp; Experience creating web sites that follow accessibility and localization best practices is a highly desired.</p><br /><p>We value versatility and full-stack experience - the majority of your work will be done working on back-end development.</p><br /><p><strong>The development team provides the majority of the support for the products they work on.</strong>&nbsp; Candidates should have experience creating reliable web applications and troubleshooting issues. Any experience implementing/using application monitoring solutions would be a benefit.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Tech Stack:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>C#</li><br /><li>NET MVC / Web API</li><br /><li>SQL Server</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Common supporting infrastructure includes:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Centralized logging with Elasticsearch and Kibana</li><br /><li>Messaging with RabbitMQ</li><br /><li>Application monitoring with New Relic</li><br /></ul><br /><p>For source control and pull requests, teams choose between:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>GitHub</li><br /><li>BitBucket</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We use automated build and deploy and encourage unit testing.</p><br /><p>Our code runs in Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS, as well as in our own data center.</p><br /><p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p><br /><p>As you&rsquo;ve probably guessed, OverDrive is a place that values individuality and variety.

Join the team for a quick 15 minute stand up huddle and review what was done on the previous day; discuss any roadblocks you may be stuck on and to get help if needed; and what the goals are for the current day. Then commence work on assigned tasks in the current Sprint. Unit tests should be written as well before critical work or after on critical functionality. Code reviews should be done and kept up daily as well. Lunch and a coffee/drink break during the day is always good to refresh your mind unless you're in the zone of course!</p><br /><p>An example task you may be asked to work on is a new UI to schedule employees onto jobs sites. First you will branch from the master code branch from GitHub and start a new task branch locally to begin work. You would work off of the specifications and design to implement the UI and reuse components already built for the front-end WorkMax UI so we stay consistent. You would write any custom business logic in Angular/React to manage the new UI and do normal checks for required fields, etc. Then you would write the code to submit off requests to the back-end through the provided API from the back-end team. Good error checking and unit test where applicable would be part of your coding process as well. You would then test your implementation on a local WorkMax environment all Devs have to make sure your new code works as specified. Once happy, the code would be submitted off to GitHub in a Pull Request so it can be reviewed and into the normal Agile process. Once approved it's merged back into a build and sent to QA for testing.</p><br /><p>Your skill set will be enhanced on the WorkMax platform as we develop new modules and as we use newer technology that makes sense as we move forward. We will always stay up on the latest and best technology out there!</p>","Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:40:46 Z",2020-02-06T15:40:46Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"Payson, UT",

We make the world&rsquo;s markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.</p><br /><p>Algo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT&rsquo;s trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don&rsquo;t mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.</p><br /><p>Our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company&rsquo;s Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.</p><br /><p>We are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that&rsquo;s probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java.</p><br /><p>Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>When he&rsquo;s not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David&rsquo;s writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like &ldquo;one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays&rdquo;. He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.</li><br /><li>Kai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.</li><br /><li>Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates&rsquo; happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.</li><br /></ul>","Mon, 03 Feb 2020 15:17:26 Z",2020-02-03T15:17:26Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"New York, NY",

Generally, consumer frontends are written in React/ES6, and backends in Typescript (Express for REST APIs and native websockets for RTC). We use Redis as a message broker and Postgres as a persistent datastore. Our infrastructure is (mostly) on AWS.</p><br /><p>The most visually-prominent consumer product is the Koji IDE, a web-based editor that connects to a remote development server and enables full-stack development from any device with a browser. The remote development server uses Docker to create a per-project environment that runs both the editor server (file writes, PTY operations, OT-based real-time collaboration, Git operations, etc.) and the processes/servers required for the user to develop their project (backend servers, frontend dev servers, test runners, etc).</p><br /><p>At a high level, the web editor&rsquo;s frontend uses VSCode&rsquo;s Monaco as a text editor and a custom parser that renders Koji-compliant JSON config files into intuitive visual controls. Because Koji projects are simply modern, standards-compliant Javascript projects (or projects that ultimately target JS), this hybrid approach gives our users the benefits of easy, visual configuration using no-code patterns for manipulating project-level config (strings, colors, styles, mechanics, settings, etc.) without subjecting them to the usual restrictions of no-code/low-code platforms (complex, unintuitive controls; ballooning trees/graphs once projects go beyond simple basics; no ability to drop down and edit native code; etc.).</p><br /><p>Because Koji projects are staged in the cloud during development, the web editor&rsquo;s live preview can be opened on any internet-connected device (without the need for ngrok, mobile device proxies, etc.). The editor provides some additional tools for easily testing backend routes and manipulating PTYs.</p><br /><p>Koji projects are backend by Git repositories. By default, new projects use a Git remote hosted by Koji&rsquo;s Git server, but projects can also use repositories hosted by third-parties as their remotes. The Koji deploy pipeline uses Git hooks to trigger new builds (build steps are defined by a JSON file within the project) and shows build progress, logs, and notifications inside the web editor. Projects can deploy static bundles or dynamic services that are compiled, containerized, and deployed using Google&rsquo;s Cloud Run.</p><br /><p>Once a project is deployed, it can be accessed by an auto-generated subdomain. From within the editor, users can also register a custom subdomain on one of our root domains (e.g., myproject.withkoji.com), or register a custom domain name and configure DNS to point that domain to our CDN. We take care of HTTPS provisioning, deployment, and renewal automatically with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, and all projects are accelerated with our CDN partner, Fastly.</p><br /><p>The CDN that serves deployed projects can also inject plugins at runtime based on path/pattern matching, which lets users easily enable features like Open Graph tags (something that is typically difficult to do on client-side SPAs without SSR or services like Prerender) or integrate things like Google Analytics. The web editor also renders server access logs for deployed projects, giving users an easy way to understand traffic and growth without the need for any third-party analytics/tracking tools.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p>We are looking for a senior engineer who enjoys shipping products, understanding and designing systems at a high level, and anticipating future challenges while designing and operating within near-term constraints.</p><br /><p>Low-level specialization is a less important consideration for this role. Our ideal candidate is someone with a big appetite, who enjoys exploring and processing big ideas with far-reaching considerations, and who has the drive and ambition to execute on solutions to those problems with an appropriate attention to detail and love of craft. We are a small team, and we are looking for someone we can trust to make big decisions, shape the direction of their role, and ultimately shape the direction of the platform.</p><br /><p>Visit our company page to find a high level overview of our current technical architecture. Experience/familiarity with the technologies we are using is a plus, but is secondary to the more general sensibilities and experience that define the requirements of this role.</p><br /><p>If this description sounds like a fit in any form, and the vision of the platform appeals to you, let&rsquo;s get to know each other.</p>","Wed, 29 Jan 2020 23:49:58 Z",2020-01-29T23:49:58Z,http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/,"San Diego, CA",

You will be heavily involved in design and architecture discussions and&nbsp;decision making&nbsp;on the existing platform functionality as well as new modules being added into the platform&nbsp;as well as coding of the core code, both existing and new. You will be responsible for code reviews of your peers and being able to generate builds for QA. This position deals mainly with the back-end hosted web application written in C#. Knowledge and experience in eCommerce and robust, scalable, and secure web application architecture and coding practices are a huge plus as well. Knowledge of RESTful API and JSON data is also a plus. Although not required for this position, front-end application development knowledge for web technology stacks using HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript, AngularJS, ReactJS would be a plus.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>A&nbsp;typical day in this position is to start off with some coffee and/or your favorite drink and breakfast; catch up on email and Slack and&nbsp;review your tasks in&nbsp;Jira on the current Sprint,&nbsp;&nbsp;then join the team for a quick 15 minute stand-up huddle and review what was done the previous day; what roadblocks you may be stuck on and to get help if needed; and what the goals are for the current day. Then commence work on assigned tasks in the current Sprint. Unit tests should be written as well before critical work or after on critical functionality. Code reviews should be done and kept up daily as well. Lunch and a coffee/drink break during the day is always good to refresh your mind unless you're in the zone of course!</p><br /><p>An example&nbsp;work task&nbsp;for this position might be something like adding a new entity, business logic, and API support for a front-end application to connect to and use. To start off, you would create a local task branch from the master branch&nbsp;of code from GutHub for your work in the current Sprint and into your local Visual Studio environment. Maybe you then create a new entity or add properties to an existing entity that get processed through Entity Framework and into the PostgreSQL database schema using Entity Framework . You would get familiar with scripting we have in place to automate most of this process. You would then write business logic in C# to perform CRUD operations on that new or modified entity. You would then write code to expose that functionality to the API and eventually an HTTPS endpoint the client code can communicate with. You will use the unit test framework in place to write and perform any unit tests on your work. You can then invoke a build and test the application with your changes on a local WorkMax environment all devs have. Once happy with your work, you would issue a pull request for review by a peer via Git/GitHub and&nbsp;push your work to the main repository for next steps.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Your skill set will be enhanced on the WorkMax platform as we develop new modules and as we use newer technology that makes sense as we move forward.
